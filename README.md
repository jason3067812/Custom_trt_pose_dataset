# Customized_trt_pose_dataset
## Introduction
We found that when the trt_pose model was dealing with videos of people who fell, the frame of the person at certain angles would be unrecognizable. This is because most of the original dataset and data augment are walking people and dancing dancers.
## Method

Customized trt_pose training dataset (data loader, data augmentation).
## Environment
- Pytorch
- Python
